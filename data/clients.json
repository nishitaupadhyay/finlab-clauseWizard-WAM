      "details": "Lawrence appears to be 3 years from retirement and is estimated to have $40k in investable assets that are not invested in The Fund. Lawrence has been with The Fund for over three years and favors a low risk profile and passive management. Of the assets with The Fund, they appear to draw from a broad array of fund managers, including both The Fund-affiliated and outside funds. However, his current investment mix is stock-heavy, which may pose a risk at his age. It is recommended that Lawrence switch to a more bond-heavy investment strategy to better align with his low tolerance and nearing retirement.",
      "meeting_notes": "In the last meeting, Lawrence expressed interest in knowing about trusts and wills for his family, and also increasing his 401k contribution. During our review this week, it was noted that one of the funds Lawrence is heavily invested in experienced a 2% decline in value over the past month."
